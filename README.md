# react-mui-wrapper-tests t01
Experiments in React / TypeScript with wrapping MUI components

See [main branch ReadMe](https://github.com/TonyGravagno/react-mui-wrapper-tests/tree/main) for general info

### Branch t03 2023/08/15

#### Expanding on t02

- Moved TestForm1 into folder like components, and added TestForm2.
- index.ts is required in these folders to export the contents of the code folders. I'm going to look at reducing down to a single index.ts for all forms, another for all components, etc.
