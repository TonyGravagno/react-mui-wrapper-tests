# react-mui-wrapper-tests  : Branch rhf01 : 2023/09/08 

See [recap](https://github.com/TonyGravagno/react-mui-wrapper-tests/tree/rhf00#readme).

RHF01 works like T08 : It looks like hell and only one component is supported, FieldText. But I think all of the files are where they belong now and the old switching components have been removed.

Next steps in RHF02 : Actually get the other components working with RHF : FieldLabel, FieldTextArea, FieldCheckbox, SubmitButton. The PersonMaintForm will need to be updated, and as fields are added, PersonSchema and related files will also need to be updated to add new fields that will test each of the added components.
